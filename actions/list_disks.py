List disks

The 'disks' key is populated with block devices that are known by udev,
are not mounted and not mentioned in 'osd-journal' configuration option.

The 'blacklist' key is populated with osd-devices in the blacklist stored
in the local kv store of this specific unit.

The 'non-pristine' key is populated with block devices that are known by
udev, are not mounted, not mentioned in 'osd-journal' configuration option
and are currently not eligible for use because of presence of foreign data.
